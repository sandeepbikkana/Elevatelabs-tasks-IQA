#GITHUB pages

1. What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service from GitHub that lets you publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It’s commonly used for portfolios, documentation, and simple project pages.

2. Can you host dynamic apps here?
Not directly. GitHub Pages only supports static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

You can use client-side JavaScript to fetch data from APIs.

Server-side features (like PHP, databases, or Python backends) aren’t supported.

3. What are the limits of GitHub Pages?

Size limit per repository: 1 GB.

Published site size limit: ~1 GB.

Bandwidth limit: 100 GB/month.

Build limit: 10 builds per hour (for automatic Jekyll builds).

Only supports HTTPS (which is a plus).

4. How do you update the website?

Push new commits to the branch GitHub Pages is using (usually main or gh-pages).

GitHub automatically rebuilds and deploys the updated site.

5. What happens when you delete the repo?

The GitHub Pages site is deleted immediately (and the URL becomes inactive).

There’s no automatic backup — you’d need to have your files stored locally or elsewhere.

6. What is the default file that loads?

index.html in the site’s root folder (or in /docs if you configured Pages to use that).

If no index.html is found, it will show a directory listing (unless blocked) or a 404 page.

7. Can you use a custom domain?
Yes. You can configure a custom domain in the repo’s Pages settings and point your domain’s DNS to GitHub’s servers. Supports both HTTP and HTTPS (via free SSL from GitHub).
